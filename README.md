# World Around You

A digital library of stories, created collaboratively by Deaf and hearing people for Deaf children and their families, the school community, and the Deaf community. It is a web platform designed to make collaboration easy for uploading and editing contents for reading and viewing. It provides a space to watch, read, interact, like, share, comment, upload, and edit the contents. 

This repo holds the style guides, wireframes, and prototype implementation of the reader's view, beginning with Filipino Sign Language (FSL).

In the reader's view, each dot along the main slider bar represents a page in the story. Each page has 3 components, or sub-pages: 1) photo, 2) signed video, and 3) glossary interactivity. A sample story is shown in this prototype: "Malakas and Maganda." 

All dependencies are included. This prototype can run offline.

## Operating instructions

However, GitHub serves large files with a lag. Videos are considered large files. For optimal performance, download repo and run on a local server such as `php -S localhost:4000`.

## Key functionalities

- After hovering over menu buttons for 0.5 seconds, a text description appears. Users often will stay that long on a button if they are uncertain what it does.

    - Click on glossary terms to view interactivity (video loop & photo corresponding to term). Click anywhere else on the screen to stop the video loop & return to original view.
